# 🍺 Homebrew Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the missing package manager, on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## 🖥️ Windows (via WSL2)

Homebrew does not run natively on Windows. To use it, you must use the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)**.

### 1. Enable WSL2

Open **PowerShell** as Administrator and run:

```powershell
wsl --install

```

*Note: You may need to restart your computer after this step.*

### 2. Install Homebrew

Once your Linux terminal (e.g., Ubuntu) is open, run the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

```

### 3. Add to Path

After installation, Homebrew will provide two or three commands in the terminal output to add `brew` to your `PATH`. They usually look like this:

```bash
(echo; echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> ~/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

```

---

## 🍎 macOS

Homebrew is most at home on macOS. It supports both Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) and Intel chips.

### 1. Install Command Line Tools

Open your **Terminal** and run:

```bash
xcode-select --install

```

### 2. Run the Installer

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

```

### 3. Finalize Path (Apple Silicon only)

If you are on a Mac with Apple Silicon, run these commands to add Homebrew to your shell configuration:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

```

---

## 🐧 Linux

Homebrew for Linux (formerly known as Linuxbrew) is ideal for installing the latest tools without needing `sudo`.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Depending on your distribution, you’ll need some build tools:

| Distribution | Command |
| --- | --- |
| **Ubuntu/Debian** | `sudo apt-get install build-essential procps curl file git` |
| **Fedora** | `sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" && sudo dnf install procps-ng curl file git` |

### 2. Run the Installer

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

```

### 3. Add to Path

```bash
test -d ~/.linuxbrew && eval "$(~/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
test -d /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew && eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
echo 'eval "$($(brew --prefix)/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc

```

---

## ✅ Verify Installation

To ensure everything is working correctly on any system, run:

```bash
brew doctor

```

If you see **"Your system is ready to brew,"** you are good to go!

> **Pro-Tip:** Keep your packages updated by running `brew update` regularly.
